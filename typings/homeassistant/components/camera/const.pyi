    A camera that supports CAMERA_SUPPORT_STREAM may have a single stream
    type which is used to inform the frontend which player to use.
    Streams with RTSP sources typically use the stream component which uses
    HLS for display. WebRTC streams use the home assistant core for a signal
    path to initiate a stream, but the stream itself is between the client and
